⚠ THINGS TO CONSIDER (Unknown Unknowns)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Training Load Management
  Why it matters: Triathlon training involves managing fatigue across three sports simultaneously. Without proper recovery tracking, overtraining injuries are common.
  Impact: Watches with HRV, sleep tracking, and training stress scores help prevent burnout and optimize performance gains.

• Open Water GPS Accuracy
  Why it matters: Pool swimming vs open water requires different GPS technologies. Many watches lose signal accuracy in water, affecting distance and pace data critical for race pacing.
  Impact: Dual-frequency GPS and specific open water modes are essential for accurate triathlon data. This eliminates Garmin 265 and Apple Watch as top choices.

• Quick Band Interchange System
  Why it matters: Transitioning from sweaty training sessions to professional meetings requires different band styles. Standard pin systems are slow and cumbersome.
  Impact: Quick-release systems and availability of both sport and professional bands determine real-world usability in dual office/training environments.

• Structured Workout Programming
  Why it matters: Triathlon training requires following specific interval workouts across three sports. Without on-watch workout guidance, users rely on external devices or memory.
  Impact: Built-in workout builder and coach integration (TrainingPeaks, etc.) transforms the watch from data recorder to active training partner.

• Recovery Time Algorithms
  Why it matters: Unlike single-sport training, triathlon requires understanding which muscle groups have recovered for the next workout type (swim after hard run, etc.).
  Impact: Advanced recovery metrics help optimize training schedule and prevent injury, crucial for athletes balancing intense training with professional work stress.

🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================
Top Pick: Garmin Forerunner 965

Reasoning: Despite being at the budget ceiling, the Forerunner 965 delivers the best combination of professional aesthetics for office wear and comprehensive triathlon capabilities. The 23-day battery life eliminates training disruptions, while the AMOLED display maintains professional appearance. Its proven ecosystem integration with TrainingPeaks and comprehensive recovery metrics address the sophisticated needs of dual-purpose use. The investment pays off through reduced need for multiple devices and superior long-term training insights.

Alternatives: Choose Coros Pace 3 if budget is primary concern and you can accept a more utilitarian appearance. The exceptional 38-hour GPS battery and $220 savings make it excellent for training-focused users. Select Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro if you want AMOLED quality at budget price and don't mind less established ecosystem integration.
